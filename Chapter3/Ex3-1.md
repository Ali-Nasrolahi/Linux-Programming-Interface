**Question:**

## 3-1

When using the Linux-specific `reboot()` system call to reboot the system, the second argument, **magic2**, must be specified as one of a set of magic numbers (e.g., LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2 ). What is the significance of these numbers? (Converting them to hexadecimal provides a clue.)


**Answer:**

I do not want to ruin this for you. so checkout those hexdec numbers and you'd get it. (or just google it **not recomended** though).
