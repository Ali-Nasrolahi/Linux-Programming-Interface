## Internet Domain Sockets

Internet domain **stream sockets** are implemented on top of **TCP**.
> They provide a reliable, bidirectional, byte-stream communication channel.

Internet domain **datagram sockets** are implemented on top of **UDP**.  
UDP sockets are similar to their UNIX domain counterparts, but note the following differences:

- UNIX domain datagram sockets are reliable, but UDP sockets are not.

- Sending on a UNIX domain datagram socket will block if the queue of data for the receiving socket is full.
    > By contrast, with UDP, if the incoming datagram would overflow the receiverâ€™s queue, then the datagram is silently dropped.
