# Linux-Programming-Interface

***This repo is still in progress***.

An repository for notes (summery) and solutions to exercises from `Linux Programming Interface`, 2010.

## Disclaimer

Some of note's contents are *my own* comments, therefore **correctness** of it should be examined.

Furthermore, solutions to exercises are based on *my own understating* of question; I would try for solutions closest to author's intention; however it's **not guaranteed**.
